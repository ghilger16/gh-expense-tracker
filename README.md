#### Summary

Coming from the finance world I had to make an expense tracker.  This project was my first time using a front-end framework.  Although challenging
at times to learn, it is clearly beneficial to use over vanilla Javasctipt. The virtual dom helps make react much faster and using reusable components is a
lot easier to read and use. With this project I was able to utilize the many concepts unique to React such as, functional components, JSX, props, state and even
lifecycle methods.
